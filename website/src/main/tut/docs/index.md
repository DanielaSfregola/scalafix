# Installation

You can use scalafix in two ways:

- as a tool for running rules against your codebase, either using {% doc_ref scalafix-cli %} or {% doc_ref sbt-scalafix %}

- as a library for authoring your own rewrites (see {% doc_ref scalafix-core %})

It may be possible to add IDE integrations such as IntelliJ/ENSIME in the future,
but it is not a priority.
