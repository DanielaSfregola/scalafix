@sect{Configuration}
  Scalafix reads configuration from a file using
  @lnk("HOCON", "https://github.com/typesafehub/config")
  syntax.
  I recommend you put a file @code{.scalafix.conf} into the root directory of
  your project. However, the file can be put anywhere you like.

  @sect{rewrites}
    Available options are listed in @sect.ref{Rewrites}.

    @config
      rewrites = [ExplicitImplicit] # No rewrites are run if empty.
