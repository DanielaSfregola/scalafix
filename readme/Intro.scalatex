@p
  Scalafix is a Scala code rewriting tool and library.
  This effort follows the Scala Center Advisory Board proposal:
  @lnk("Clarification of Scala to Dotty migration path", "http://scala-lang.org/blog/2016/05/30/scala-center-advisory-board.html#the-first-meeting").
  The long-term goal of the project is to automate migration from Scala 2.x to @dotty,
  a next-generation Scala compiler.

@p
  The name "scalafix" is inspired by
  @lnk("gofix", "https://golang.org/cmd/fix/"),
  a similar tool used to migrate code written in the Go programming language.
