`SemanticTree` is a sealed data structure that encodes tree nodes that are
generated by the compiler from inferred type parameters, implicit arguments,
implicit conversions, inferred `.apply` and for-comprehensions.

```scala mdoc:file:scalafix-core/src/main/scala/scalafix/v1/SemanticTree.scala
sealed abstract class SemanticTree...
...case object NoTree
```

## SemanticDB

The structure of `SemanticTree` mirrors SemanticDB `Tree`. For comprehensive
documentation about SemanticDB trees, consult the SemanticDB specification:

- [General trees](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/blob/master/semanticdb/semanticdb3/semanticdb3.md#type)
- [Scala trees](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/blob/master/semanticdb/semanticdb3/semanticdb3.md#java-tree)

The `SemanticTree` data structure diverges from SemanticDB `Tree` in few minor
details.

### `SemanticTree` instead of `Tree`

Scalafix uses the name `SemanticTree` instead of `Tree` in order to avoid
ambiguous references with `scala.meta.Tree` when importing the two packages
together.

```scala
import scalafix.v1._
import scala.meta._
```

### `OriginalTree` vs. `OriginalSubTree`

Scalafix has two kinds of original trees, `OriginalTree` and `OriginalSubTree`,
while the SemanticDB specification has only one `OriginalTree`. The difference
between the two is that

- `OriginalTree` represents synthetic trees whose range match exactly the
  enclosing `Synthetic` range.
- `OriginalSubTree` represents trees whose range is smaller than the enclosing
  `Synthetic` range.

This change avoids the need for the SemanticDB `Synthetic` type.
